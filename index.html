          <strong>
            It was the most watched episode in Shark Tank history when sisters Rebecca and Katie Khalife won over the
            Shark Tank panel proving millions of Americans that their product helps Quit Smoking, Detox Lungs of
            Nicotine and Tar and Helps COPD.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rebecca and Katie Khalife, sisters and chemists from MIT, net the biggest deal in Shark Tank history as all 6
          Sharks teamed up to seed the company with the astonishing $4.5 million dollars! In just a short 6 months,
          their product has completely disrupted
          <strong>
            Tobacco
          </strong>
          industry in the United States, and with the help of the Sharks, they are now ready to take over the world
          market.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a complete re-brand and re-packaging, the sisters are now ready to launch their new brand,
          <a href="{offer_link}" >
            Reviv CBD Gummies </a>
          . See the amazing demonstration below that got the Sharks ready to feed instantly!
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently the Khalife sisters have invented a new CBD Gummies formula that can
          <strong>
            stop Nicotine Cravings instantly &amp; for good,detox lungs of Nicotine &amp; Tar &amp; Increase Oxygen
            Level in COPD
          </strong>
          in response to losing their mother to the negative effects of her smoking addiction. "She was a great mother
          but for years ever since I was 14-years old she struggled with quiting smoking and never seemed to be able to
          stop..
          As she got older her health begin to rapidly deteriorate and at times she would go to the urgent care with
          trouble breathing and heart problems.." recalls Katie.
        </p>
        <p>
          In early August 2019 their mother was diagnosed with COPD and then stage 3 lung cancer. She`s had multiple
          tumors which had spread to her lymph nodes. Doctors immediately forced her to quit and started her on oxygen
          and aggressive chemotherapy.
          Tragically after battling the disease for 10 months she wasn't able to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This was a very tough time for us. We saw our mother go from this youthful 43 yr old homemaker to a glimpse
          of life in just a few short months. She had never had issues with her health and signs of COPD and cancer
          didn't show up until it was too late!"

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            While there are a number of "supplements" on the market that are claiming to help Quit Smoking &amp; Detox
            Lungs or treat COPD, the Khalife sisters have created the first reuptake inhibitor (RI), making it
            immediately Stop Smoking Cravings permanently and remove Nicotine and Tar from lungs.
            It helps lungs recovery what increases oxygen level as well.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          RI's work by blocking the inhibiting the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter from
          the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron. What this means to people without a doctorate in chemistry:
          <strong>
            a powerful help to Quit Smoking, Lungs Detox and COPD.
          </strong>

        <p>
          Tobacco industry is a massive market, but it's seldom reported on. Studies have shown that Smoking causes 16
          Million deaths aroudn the world each year! Tobacco use will be responsible for more than 28 Million deaths
          annually by 2030.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to test validity of the Khalife sister's product, Shark Tank decided to take a volunteer from their
          production crews. Meet Frank Smith, a 64 year-old chemist who jumped at the chance to test this product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frank had been struggling to Quit Smoking for over 23 years and COPD for over 3 years. We had to wait 2 weeks
          before we got a Bottle to test as it was sold out almost everywhere we looked. We track his progress for the
          14 days test.

          <p>
            I took two gummies and forgot all about the smoking. About 1-2 hour later I started to strangely feel
            better. I can only describe it by saying that it was easier to breathe somehow.
            I was walking inside a shopping mall and usually I would have been a bit dizzy with headache, and also would
            have had some cravings by that point, but I was absolutely fine. For a moment it felt like I never had
            smoked. It was a hopeful feeling and I became really curious for what would happen next -
            <a href="{offer_link}" >

            “Over the course of the next 5 days I started to feel better and better! My oxygen level increased and I
            could breathe much easier. I found myself bouncing out of bed and felt ready to take on the day - usually I
            need to cough at least a couple times. I felt motivation like I had not felt in years.
            I had higher levels of energy constantly and my breathing improved, rather than the ups and downs I was used
            to. I had also been able to sleep all night long!

            detoxed from most of the tar.
            I had no idea natural CBD Gummies could make this big of a positive difference in how I felt. I am so
